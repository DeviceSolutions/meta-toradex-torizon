Subject: [PATCH] disable boot splash later

Currently we have one big target (multi-user.target) for lots of
services. This does not allow to order the plymouth-quit.service to get
started at the very end. Work around by explicitly order after
docker.service.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [embedded specific]

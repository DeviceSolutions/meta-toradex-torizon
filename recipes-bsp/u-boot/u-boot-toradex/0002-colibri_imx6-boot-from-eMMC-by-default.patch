Subject: [PATCH 2/4] colibri_imx6: boot from eMMC by default

Boot from internal eMMC by default. This serves as a basic security
mechansim since TorizonCore is meant as a ready to use distribution.
Booting from external SD-card can be exploited in case a SD-card slot
is made accessible to the outside.
